What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Initializing the repository creates a .git folder to store the meta data of changes to your files. 
	You need it to start creating a record of commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is a temporary organizational structure of files.
	It allows you to keep track of all the files you've changed

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Add related changes to the staging area and commit when finished.
