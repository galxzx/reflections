When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  A remote respository allows other people to view and work on your project without access to your local machine.
  You may also want to work on a project from different computers, etc.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	The remote repository may contain changes that somebody else has made that you are not ready for or don't want to implement.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks copy a repository from github to github, both remote.
	Clones copy a repository from remote to local.
	Branches create a separate commit structure/ copy locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	You can compare changes to the remote while you are offline before merging with your local master.
