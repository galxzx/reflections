When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  A remote respository allows other people to view and work on your project without access to your local machine.
  You may also want to work on a project from different computers, etc.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	The remote repository may contain changes that somebody else has made that you are not ready for or don't want to implement.
